			<p>Captain Sebastián Cortez was a man who believed the sea owed him everything. Born in Cádiz to a shipwright's family, he learned the language of tides before he learned to write his own name. By thirty, he commanded his own vessel — the <em>Peregrine</em> — and carved his legend across the Shattered Sea.</p>
			<p>Cortez was a pirate of precision, not chaos. He studied the ocean like scripture, charting hidden currents and unclaimed routes that made him both feared and envied. To him, the sea was not a mystery — it was a challenge. Something to master.</p>
			<p>When whispers spread of a region beyond the edge of any map — a vast, windless expanse known only as the Maw — Cortez saw it not as danger, but destiny. He believed that whatever lay at the center of the world's waters would grant him dominion over them.</p>

			<h2>The Fall</h2>

			<p>The voyage into the Maw lasted forty-one days. The stars vanished. The compasses spun. The water grew still. By the forty-second, half the crew had gone mad — hearing voices in the tide, seeing shapes beneath the hull. The Peregrine's decks wept saltwater, and Cortez's pride turned to fear.</p>
			<p>When the storm came, it rose not from the sky but from below. His crew mutinied, blaming him for their doom, and cast him overboard in chains. As he sank, Cortez felt his lungs burn, his heart pound — and then something vast pressed against his mind.</p>
			<p><strong>It didn't speak. It breathed through him.</strong></p>

			<h2>The Rebirth</h2>

			<p>Days later, the <em>Peregrine</em> was found adrift — crewless, its timbers groaning like a living thing. At its helm stood a figure pale as moonlight, water dripping endlessly from his coat. His eyes glowed faint blue, his voice low and steady as the tide.</p>
			<p>He no longer answered to Sebastián Cortez. He was the ocean's will given flesh — the herald of the deep. He was <strong>Abyss</strong>.</p>
			<p>Sailors say the Gravewake moves with no wind, drawn only by hunger. They say her captain no longer breathes, and that when his ship appears on the horizon, the sea grows perfectly still — as though waiting to see which souls will join it below.</p>
